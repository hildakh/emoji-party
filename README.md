#### To generate a random combined emoji & save it as png
- Run `node scrape-emoji.js` from `client` folder
- The new emoji is saved in the output folder as `.png`

#### To create a new Notion page with title, content & icon (emoji)
- Run `node notion-page-generator.js --title="Your page title" --content="Some content"` from `client` folder to add a new page to your selected database. It comes with a random combined emoji!

#### To automate adding emojis to created & updated pages on Notion using [Make](https://www.make.com/en)
- Create a New Vercel Project from command line. `yarn run vercel` and create a new project.
- On [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) dashboard, select your new project, navigate to settings and set the environment variables
- From a terminal, run `yarn run vercel:deploy` to deploy your project
- To test your integration locally, run `yarn run vercel:dev` to start a local server. Make a cURL request to Vercel's local server
  ```
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/update-page" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-secret-key: api-secret-key" \
  --data '{"pageId": "a-notion-page-id"}'
  ```
  Watch the page on Notion as it gets its new look

- To automate the process, go to [Make](https://www.make.com/en) and log in.
- Click "Create a new scenario".
- Click "Add Module" and select Notion. Select --> Watch Database Items.
- Set up Notion and Http request modules.

##### Set up Notion module
You can watch items on create or update. I have created two scenarios to watch both so a created or updated page with no emiji gets the update

#### Create a notion page with no emoji. Go to your scenario on Make and **Run once**. Watch your notion page as it gets its emoji. Set your scenario you run as frequently as you wish. On free tier, the interval can be 15 minutes or more
